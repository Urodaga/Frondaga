# Urodaga - Dots & Boxes Frontend

## Development setup
It is recommended to clone the parent repository instead. Once you do, go into the
project directory 'Frondaga', and run the following:

```bash
# Initialising this repo as a submodule
git submodule init
git submodule update

# Installing dependencies
npm install
```

To run the development server, run the following:
```bash
npm run dev
```

To build a production-ready build, run:
```bash
npm run build:prod
```
